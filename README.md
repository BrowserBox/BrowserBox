## Installation

Follow these instructions to install BrowserBoxPro on your system.

### Initial Machine Setup

Before installing BrowserBoxPro, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- Debian VPS with 1 cores, 1 GB RAM, and 25 GB SSD (e.g. Nanode from Linode)
- At least 5 Mbps internet connection
- A public hostname with a DNS A record pointing to your VPS's IP address, or localhost certificates installed on your local and remote machine (for example using [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert))

First, update your distribution:

`apt update && apt -y upgrade`

And install a few basic tools:

`apt install curl git wget`

Now, prepare the machine by following these steps:

1. Create a new user to operate BrowserBoxPro:
   ```
   adduser pro
   ```

2. Disable the password for the newly created user:
   ```
   usermod -L pro
   ```

3. Create a new group for sudo privileges:
   ```
   addgroup sudoers
   ```

4. Add the following line to the sudoers file to avoid entering a password for sudo operations:
   ```
   %sudoers ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
   ```
   Use the `visudo` command to edit the sudoers file.

5. Grant sudo privileges to the user:
   ```
   usermod -G sudoers pro
   ```

Switch to the `pro` user by executing the following command:
```
sudo -u pro bash
```

### Installation Process

Follow these steps to install BrowserBoxPro:

1. Clone the BrowserBoxPro repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dosyago/BrowserBoxPro
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd BrowserBoxPro
   ```

3. Run the global installation script, replacing `<domain_name>` with your domain name that points to the machine you're setting up (if you want to use it without a domain name, just use localhost here for the domain name, but you'll still need to copy the correct mkcert localsthost certificates to $HOME/sslcerts later):
   ```
   ./deploy-scripts/global_install.sh <domain_name>
   ```

4. Start the main service on port 8080 and generate the login link:
   ```
   setup_bbpro --port 8080
   ```

5. Launch BrowserBoxPro:
   ```
   bbpro
   ```

During the installation process, BrowserBoxPro will automatically install the required dependencies and configure the necessary settings.

### Purchasing a commercial license

Purchasing takes a minute. Our purchasing form accepts credit cards, bank transfers and many other forms of payment. Once purchased, you'll receive a commercial license PDF including your agreement and valid Order receipt and you will be all set to use BrowserBox Pro in your commercial applications. With the purchase of a commercial license:

- Customers and users of your products do not need to purchase their own license &mdash; so long as they are not developing their own commercial products with BrowserBox Pro.

*Please note that we cannot transact with sanctioned countries, entities or individuals.* 

Commercial Licenses are priced per seat. A seat is someone who uses the BrowserBox Pro system, either in an internal application (like secure email attachment viewing), or an external customer-facing application (such as a customer of your remote browser isolation product). Commercial Licenses come in two flavors:

- **Perpetual License** This is a license to use the version of BrowserBox Pro you purchase forever. The version can be updated to the latest via purchase of yearly licenses.
- **Yearly License** This is a license to use the latest version available within the 12-months from your purchase. It can be manually renewed every year, or you can subscribe so it renews automatically.

Commercial Licenses are available in two sizes:

- **Individual License** Purchasable at [our GumRoad site](https://dosyo.gumroad.com). This is suitable for individuals or small teams working on commercial projects who don't want to use the AGPLv3.
- **License Pack** Available in multiple sizes, from the small to the truly epic, with commensurately epic discounts at scale. These are purchasable at [our main website](https://dosyago.com).

By obtaining a commercial license, you gain the freedom to tailor BrowserBox Pro to your specific requirements and integrate it seamlessly into your workflow. This empowers organizations to leverage the advanced features and capabilities of BrowserBox Pro while maintaining full control over its customization and usage. 

Support tiers and customization may be separately negotiated and purchased. To discuss your needs, please [reach out to our helpful support team here](mailto:support@dosyago.com?subject=BrowserBox%20Pro).

### Hardware Appliance (OEM) Licensing

Are you an OEM and want to deploy BBPro on a hardware device that you sell to your customers? [Contact us for special access to Appliance License pricing with Volume Discounts](mailto:sales@dosyago.com?subject=OEM%20License). This pricing sheet and terms are tailored to suit OEM's delivering security products for business and industry. Please note that if you are supplying government or other non-commercial users you cannot "pass through" DOSYAGO's non-commercial license to your customers without licensing a Commercial license from us. 

### Sanctions Compliance

Unfotunately if you or your company are an OFAC sanctioned entity or other entity sanctioned by the US Government (e.g. designated on OFAC's SDN List, BIS's DPL or Entity List, DDTC's DPL, or on the FBI's various lists, among others) we are unable to offer you a license of any form. Please note that in some cases we may conduct necessary checks to ensure sanctions compliance. 

### Licensing Summary 

BrowserBox Pro offers flexible licensing options to cater to different usage scenarios. As previously mentioned, BBPro software is available for free for non-commercial use under the PolyForm NonCommercial license. This allows individuals and non-profit organizations to enjoy the benefits of BrowserBox Pro without any licensing fees when using the software without any participation in or anticipation of commercial application. The PolyForm NonCommercial license ensures that the software is used strictly for non-commercial purposes.

Whether it's for non-commercial or commercial purposes, BrowserBox Pro provides a range of licensing options to accommodate different user needs and ensure a secure and powerful browsing experience.

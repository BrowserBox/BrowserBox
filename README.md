==========

>*BrowserBox: a browser you run on a server, rather than your local device. The web **browser** becomes a web **app**. Abstract your web content. Secure your network. Program across sites. Access the web from anywhere, anywhere!*

BrowserBox is a tiny, web-based browser that's embeddable anywhere. It's also multiplayer, allowing
many clients to screen share the same browsing session at the same time. It's lightweight and fast, 
consuming the minimum system resources while adapting its streaming quality to take advantage of as
much bandwidth as is available to provide a low-lag, responsive experience. 

It's the only remote browser that works seamlessly on mobile devices, because, instead of just using a 
virtual desktop or VNC layer, we virtualize the browser itself and fully control every part of it, ensuring
when you view BrowserBox on a mobile device, you get a mobile browser on the server.

## Install and Run Options

We provide a variety of install and run options, with instructions listed in this README. They include:

- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dosyago/browserbox) - pull, then use `./deploy-scripts/run_docker.sh` after tagging the pulled image to `ghcr.io/browserbox/browserbox:latest`
- [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/BrowserBox/packages) - just use `./deploy-scripts/run_docker.sh` directly or via bash redirect with curl (the *no clone* option :rocket:).
- [Manual `git clone` and `./deploy-scripts/global_install.sh`](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-install---most-flexible-and-most-reliable-) - simple, flexible, direct. Perfect for development. See the [screencast &mdash; Deploying BrowserBox from 0 to 1: *"Recorded in High Definition ASCII-nema Vision"*](https://asciinema.org/a/654866)
[![Screenshot of BrowserBox running on the CloudTabs SaaS][GIFSHOT]][ASCII]
- [1-Click Cloud Deploy to Vultr, AWS, Azure or Linode](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox?tab=readme-ov-file#1-click-deploy---deploy-browserbox-to-the-cloud-instantly--tada-cyclone) - great for using it right away.
- Pull from a mirror (SourceForge, but it lags behind the official repo [on GitHub](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox)), or a fork (https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/forks) &ndash; then use one the manual install option. But we recommend always using the latest code from our [Official BrowserBox GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox).
- [Windows Edition](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/BrowserBox-Installer/1.5.8.20) - via the PowerShell Gallery installer package. In beta, so currently may be a little brittle or fragile, but the only option if you need to run natively on Windows. As a bonus we figured out how to get audio to stream from a Windows server without an active RDP connection, and without installing a virtual audio driver. We rock! üöÄ ‚ù§Ô∏è

# Getting Started Guide

You may run BrowserBox via a variety of easy to access means. The simplest and most stable is the full manual install. Simple spin up a VPS, VM baremetal server, or even your local device of choice and follow the instructions below and you'll be up and running in two jiffies! :joy_cat:

> [!NOTE]
> In case you're wondering, right now we don't track any telemetry at all. Not even that email address you'll enter. We plan to, in future one day, begin collecting at least your email, for the following purpose only: to very cautiously and tripatiously invite you to join a mailing list to receive updates on BrowserBox. *But not today.*

## Install and Run Via Docker - Easiest and Fastest, but can be less Reliable ‚úÖ

To run BrowserBox docker easily you need to use the included **run script**: `./deploy-scripts/run_docker.sh PORT HOST EMAIL` and follow the instructions. 

Equivalently, use npm to install the global `bbox` command which just executes the docker run script:

```console
$ npm i -g @dosyago/browserbox@latest
$ bbox
```

> [!NOTE]
> We use a run script to avoid you needing to manually bridge a range of ports, run the correct command, and ensure HTTPS certificates are set up across a range of deployment scenarios. Worry not, our intrepid `run_docker.sh` script will guide you through everything you need.

You can get started right away, just follow the prompts when you run the below to install and run the latest BrowserBox on Docker:

```console
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/boss/deploy-scripts/run_docker.sh) 9999 my-browser.example.com me@example.com
```

> [!TIP]
> That's all you need! Just ensure you replace the examples values above with the correct `PORT`, `HOST`, and `EMAIL` you wish to use for your deployment. Finally, a head's up: the run script may prompt you to perform some setup steps, especially on macOS. Follow those and you'll be on your way to BrowserBox Land in no time! :joy_cat:

### A note on the arguments

- `PORT` is the main port where BrowserBox will run.
- `HOST` is the hostname of the server where BrowserBox will run. It can either be localhost or a fully-qualified domain name, backed by a DNA a record.
- `EMAIL` is your email address, to agree to our terms[^1] and [LetsEncrypt's terms](https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.2-November-15-2017.pdf)[^2]
  
> [!WARNING]
> Apple macOS users may find the Docker version to be the least stable. A common problem encountered when running BrowserBox Docker on macOS is tabs inexplicably freeze on occasion. A workaround is to close the problem tab, and resume in a new tab. This issues does not occur in BrowserBox Docker on other systems.

#### Custom Docker Options

If you want, you can run a specific version manually, even pull it from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dosyago/browserbox). Just make sure you tag it as `ghcr.io/dosyago/browserbox:latest`, so you can run it via the (very much necessary) run_script:

```console
docker pull dosyago/browserbox:v7.1.2
docker tag dosyago/browserbox:v7.1.2 ghcr.io/browserbox/browserbox:latest
PORT=9999
HOST=browserbox.example.com
EMAIL=j.citizen@example.com
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/boss/deploy-scripts/run_docker.sh) $PORT $HOST $EMAIL
```

## Alternate 

Alternately you can clone the repository first and run the script direclty, like so:

```console
git clone https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox
cd BrowserBox
./deploy-scripts/run_docker.sh $PORT $HOST $EMAIL
```

*If you have issues with your deployment, it's a good idea check the cloud provider status page:*

- [Azure Status](https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status)
- [Vultr Status](https://status.vultr.com/)
- [AWS Status](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status)
- [Linode Akamai Status](https://status.linode.com/)

It's also a great idea to check cloud ping test (internet speed and round-trip time) sites before you create your 1-click deployment to create in the cloud region with the lowest ping for you. 

If you encounter any issues at all or wish to discuss licenses or customizations, or anything else, reach out to us at support@dosyago.com.

\* Azure is our recommended option because it makes deployment easieset: no need to add a separate DNS record for your instance; and Azure even emails you when the deployment is complete!

## Manual Install - Most Flexible, and Most Reliable ‚úÖ

Before we show you the step by step instructions, we'll just show you the whole thing, in one block:

```console
git clone https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox.git
cd BrowserBox
./deploy-scripts/wait_for_hostname.sh my.awesome.host.com
./deploy-scripts/global_install.sh my.awesome.host.com my-email@address.com
setup_bbpro --port 8080 > my.login.link.txt
bbpro
cat my.login.link.txt
```
You can try this right now if you just want to try it out, and don't care about getting the rights certificates for production or accessing over the public internet. 


The above commands will download, install, setup and start BrowserBox, as well as output your login link for you. Open that link (which looks like: **https://localhost:8080/login?token=csdkjhvsdfkjhv3498ysdf**) in your regular browser.

To stop your instance just issue the `stop_bbpro` command.

> [!TIP]
> The above simple method uses `my.awesome.host.com` as the hostname for your BrowserBox instance. You'll need to ensure you've set a DNS A record from `my.awesome.host.com` or your actual full domain name, to the IP address of the machine you're running BrowserBox on.

-------

***Now, let's show you the full manual install.***

1. **Download and Clone the Git Repository, and jump into the directory**:

```console
git clone https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox.git
cd BrowserBox
```

2. **Point your DNS to your machine's IP with an *A record* mapping your chosen domain name to the IPv4 address of your VPS, VM, baremetal or whatever you're setting up on.**

Check that your hostname (you were creative so you picked: **my.awesome.host.com**) resolves by running:

```console
./deploy-scripts/wait_for_hostname.sh my.awesome.host.com
```

3. **Once DNS is set up Begin the Install:**

Run the install script using your instance's full domain name and your email address. Email is for agreeing to our terms and the HTTPS certificate provider's (aka LetsEncrypt's) terms. We don't spam you! We may send you a product announce in future tho, or invite you to join a list, but such a vile transgression of the sanctity of your holy email space would be an exceedingly rare, and cautiously approached, occurrence!

```console
./deploy-scripts/global_install.sh my.awesome.host.name.com my-rockin@email.address.com
```

this will take you through the attended install where you'll need to follow prompts. To just get the defaults (good idea), you can alter that command slightly to be a yes person for you :joy_cat::

```console
yes | ./deploy-scripts/global_install.sh my.so-awesome.host.name.com my-rockin@email.address.com
```

The above will run an unattended install, where it does everything for you, and you can go away and fix yourself a delicious beverage, or what not.

> [!TIP]
> The user you install with *will* need `sudo` capabilities. But you do *not* need `sudo` caps to **run** BrowserBox once it is already installed. 

4. **Once Install Completes, Set Up, and Run!** :tada:

As soon as installation completes you'll be ready to run BrowserBox using the following two key commands:

```console
setup_bbpro --port 9999
bbpro
```

`setup_bbpro` will setup BrowserBox to bind to port 9999 (plus two either side for all its services. So ports 9997 through 10001 in this case).And will also return your very valuable, secret and crucial **login link**. This is your only way to access your BrowserBox. We save it to `$HOME/.config/dosyago/bbpro/login.link` if you lost it. Treat it like an screen sharing invite link, anyone you share that link with will be able to share, watch and drive your BrowserBox session, just like you. It's a free for all! Some may call it a melee. :joy:

`bbpro` will start BrowserBox. Give it a couple seconds to start up.

# Latest News

## v7.1.2 Maintenance Release

Our new maintenance release has just landed and includes a range of minor improvements to stability across the diverse OS platforms supported by BrowserBox, including 1-Click deploy. Of note are the support of unprivileged users, and a drastic speedup of install times for the full (including doc viewer) install. [Read more here.](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/releases/tag/v7.1.2)

We've also translated a brief README introduction to BrowserBox into a few languages. See the links at the top of the README for a version that might be in your preferred language.

## Contributing

A few tips for development:

- Ensure you use `./deploy-scripts/build_docker.sh` to build the Docker image. We build on macOS using Docker Desktop. Building on other platforms is not officially supported, tho we are open to reviewing a PR that adds a Podman build script.
- `npm test` in the root directory runs the copy of BrowserBox in the current directory. `bbpro` runs the globally installed copy. `setup_bbpro` (equivalently: `./deploy-scripts/_setup_bbpro.sh`) configures BrowserBox and applies to any copy you run, regardless of whether you run with `npm test`, or `bbpro`.
- Setting the `./src/common.js` `DEBUG.mode` key to `dev` uses the unbundled, unminified client code in `./src/public/voodoo`. Ensure you do this if you want to modify client-side code.

Contributors and developers take a look at these source diagrams of BrowserBox. 

They contain 3 main parts: Back-end (**Zombie Lord**), Front-end (**Voodoo**), User-interface 

-------

### BrowserBox *"Zombie-Lord"* Server

<a href="https://dep-tree-explorer.vercel.app/api?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbrowserbox%2Fbrowserbox.git&entrypoint=src%2Fserver.js">

  <img width="1072" alt="Here is a snapshot in 3D of the back-end. Click to play." src="https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/assets/22254235/339c8c1c-c41e-4c10-86a0-3775acbf090f"/>
  
</a>

*Zombie-Lord* is the back-end. It controls, and senses the browser and all interactions and state related to it. 

*[Click for an Interactive version of the above 3D back-end graph](https://dep-tree-explorer.vercel.app/api?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbrowserbox%2Fbrowserbox.git&entrypoint=src%2Fserver.js).* 

-------

### BrowserBox *"Voodoo"* Client

<a href="https://dep-tree-explorer.vercel.app/api?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbrowserbox%2Fbrowserbox.git&entrypoint=src%2Fpublic%2Fimage-start-app.js">

</a>

*Voodoo* is the client. It contains all client-side logic, interprets human-side user events, and presents notices from the browser-side. 

*[Click for an Interactive version of the above 3D front-end graph](https://dep-tree-explorer.vercel.app/api?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbrowserbox%2Fbrowserbox.git&entrypoint=src%2Fpublic%2Fimage-start-app.js).* 

-------

### The UI Framework

And neither of these above creations includes the [Good.HTML](https://github.com/o0101/good.html) view framework, which begins at [src/public/voodoo/src/components](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/tree/boss/src/public/voodoo/src/components) and contains all the UI logic and components to present the UI.

Taken together these 3 parts comprise BrowserBox Remote Browser.

*If you have issues with your deployment, it's a good idea check the cloud provider status page:*

- [Azure Status](https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status)
- [Vultr Status](https://status.vultr.com/)
- [AWS Status](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status)
- [Linode Akamai Status](https://status.linode.com/)

It's also a great idea to check cloud ping test (internet speed and round-trip time) sites before you create your 1-click deployment to create in the cloud region with the lowest ping for you.

\* Azure is our recommended option because it makes deployment easieset: no need to add a separate DNS record for your instance; and Azure even emails you when the deployment is complete!

## New Docker Release v7.1 

The v7.1 release includes all the updates from the latest [7-series major release](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/releases/tag/v7.0) plus a few more. 

-------
**Key points on the v7.1 release are below:**

## Secure Document Viewer enabled by default!

BrowserBox's secure document viewer for content-disarm and reconstruction-based secure viewing of all PDFs, DOCX, XLS, and many other document formats, right in the browser!

> [!TIP]
> Once the document has downloaded, a popup window will open where you can see the conversion status and eventually view the document. If that doesn't happen, look for a warning about "popup blocked", in which case you'll need to "allow popups" on your browser in order to see it. If this happens, click the download link again to give the doc viewer window another chance to reopen.

Due to customer requests, BrowserBox's Secure Document Viewer is now enabled by default! Please note that this will cause installation to take longer as many font packages are installed to ensure the correct display of a variety of document formats including: PDF, DOCX and more!

## Windows Support :joy_cat: :tada:

BrowserBox has just landed support for Windows and we're on [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/BrowserBox-Installer/1.5.8.20). Including Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022. Other platforms will be rolled out as they are tested. See the table below:


|   Windows Edition   | Compatibility   |
|---------------------|:---------------:|
| Windows Server 2022 |           ‚úÖ |
| Windows Server 2019 |           ‚úÖ |
| Windows 11          |           ‚úÖ |
| Windows 10          |           ‚úÖ |

To install and run on Windows, first do the following in PowerShell as **Administrator**:

```posh
# you may need the following 2 lines to install from PSGallery 
# if your package managers need updating
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass
Install-PackageProvider Nuget -Force 
Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -Force
```

Then **close and reopen** your PowerShell session, and run as regular user:

```posh
# the main part to install BrowserBox installer
Install-Module -Name BrowserBox-Installer
```

Then

```posh
Import-Module BrowserBox-Installer
Install-BrowserBox
```

When prompted enter the `Domain name` that will point to your Windows instance, and your `Email address` for agreeing to our terms, and LetsEncrypt terms. Then, configure your BrowserBox instance (`-Port` and optionally `-Token` for the login link):

```posh
Initialize-BrowserBox -Port 8080
```

> [!NOTE]
> While BrowserBox opens ports on the operating system, if your cloud uses external firewalls, ensure ports `Port-2` through `Port+2` (8078-8082 in the example above) are opened in your control panel.

After running `Initialize-Browserbox` you'll have your login link and you'll be ready to start BrowserBox and connect.

Finally, to start 'er up, type:

```posh
Start-BrowserBox
```

And open your login-link in any modern browser anywhere. Note that if you're connected over RDP this step will disconnect your RDP session
as we perform some voodoo-foo in order to utilize the pre-existing and good RDP Audio Driver in a way that lets us retain 
an audio stream even when you're not connected to your server.


> [!TIP]
> If you have trouble with the initial install module step (message aboutNuGet versions), this is probably a PS issue, so try (elevated):

```posh
Install-PackageProvider Nuget -Force
Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -Force
```

Then restart (close and reopen) your PowerShell session and try again.

-----

Any other issues with the installation on Windows then please [open an issue](issues) or reach out to us at anytime at [email](mailto:support@dosyago.com) or [Signal](https://signal.me/#p/+15039173547)

We've also got you covered on Linode!

üåê **Linode StackScript**: Prefer Linode as your cloud service provider? Deploy a new Linode instance pre-configured with BrowserBox. [Deploy your BrowserBox on Linode](https://cloud.linode.com/linodes/create?type=StackScripts&subtype=Community&stackScriptID=1279678).

**Remember:** You'll need to create your DNS hostname record to point to your EC2 or Linode instance's IP, after you set it up. Supply the hostname you will use to these templates. The nascent instance will wait up to 1 hour for the hostname to resolve to its IP. 

*Please note: we mostly work with Debian 12, CentOS 9, Amazon Linux, Ubuntu and MacOS, so while BrowserBox should work on other compatible distributions, if it doesn't please let us know. If you encounter any issues at all, then open an issue or email support@dosyago.com and we'll do our best to help you out!*

## üßÖ New Feature - Tor Support

***tor-iframe:***
```html
<iframe src="https://mybrowserbox.server.com:9999/login?token=cviuygf3498tysifud&ui=false&url=[&quot;https://check.torproject.org&quot;]"
        style="border:none; width:100%; height:100%;"
        allowfullscreen
        scrolling="no">
</iframe>
```

On server:
```bash
$ IFRAME_LINK=$(setup_bbpro -p 9999 --ontor)
```

You can now [browse the web through Tor when using BrowserBox](#rotating_light-browserbox-on-tor). BrowserBox also supports running itself as a [Tor hidden service](#rotating_light-latest-news-browserbox-hidden-services), so you can access your BrowserBox instances over the Tor network.

<img width="1192" alt="BrowserBox with --ontor on macOS successfully on the Tor network as checked at https://check.torproject.org" src="https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/assets/22254235/5b92a312-4d4e-49e4-bffe-7088f3abe7b1">

### :rotating_light: BrowserBox on Tor!

#### üåç Enhanced Privacy with Tor Support

We are excited to announce that BrowserBox now supports Tor, providing you with a more private and secure browsing experience. This feature is still in alpha, but we're committed to continuously improving it to match the security level of the Tor Browser over time.

**Key Features:**
- **Onion Sites Accessibility**: Browse [`.onion`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion) websites seamlessly.
- **Privacy-First Browsing**: Enhanced encryption for anonymity and security. Tor conceals the IP address of your RBI server.
- **Socks5 Proxy Integration**: Traffic securely routed over a Socks5 proxy.
- **Simple Tor Activation**: Easy activation using the `--ontor` flag.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Tested on macOS and Debian.

#### :gear: Using BrowserBox with Tor

Activate Tor in BrowserBox with this command:

```shell
$ setup_bbpro <your-normal-args> --ontor
$ bbpro
```

*If you want to switch it off again, shut down as normal (`pm2 delete all`), and re-run `setup_bbpro` without the `--ontor` flag.*

Start exploring the web with Tor's added security.

#### :warning: Important Caveats and Commitment to Security

As this Tor integration is in *alpha*, there are several important considerations:

- **Proxy and Tor Escapes**: There's a potential for some requests to bypass the Socks5 Tor proxy or Tor itself, which could impact privacy. We are actively working to identify and mitigate these risks.
- **Adherence to Tor Guidelines**: We aspire to aligning our Tor integration as closely as possible with the best practices recommended by the Tor Project. This includes careful configuration to prevent leaks and maintaining the anonymity that Tor provides.
- **Ongoing Security Enhancements**: Our goal is to eventually provide a level of security comparable to the Tor Browser. We'll be regularly updating and improving the Tor functionality in BrowserBox.
- **Exploring Alternatives**: We are considering the integration of alternative browsers like Brave as the underlying engine for RBI, which may offer a more secure base than Chrome for Tor browsing.

#### :speech_balloon: Your Input is Valuable

Your feedback is crucial for our continuous improvement. Please report any issues or suggestions to enhance the Tor functionality on our GitHub issues page. Contributions, especially those that help achieve parity with Tor Browser's security, are highly appreciated.

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements in BrowserBox, and as always, enjoy a secure browsing experience!

### üöÄ Installable PWAs on Desktop

You can now install BrowserBox as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your desktop! This means smoother performance, offline capabilities, and a more integrated experience with your operating system. 

**Key Benefits:**
- **Seamless Integration:** Feel the power of a native app with the flexibility of a web application.
- **Offline Access:** Access essential features even without an internet connection.
- **Reduced Resource Usage:** Enjoy a more efficient use of system resources compared to traditional web browsing.

### üîó Protocol Links Support

Introducing protocol links support with `web+bb://`. Now, you can open links directly in BrowserBox by prefacing them with `web+bb://`. This feature allows for more efficient navigation and a streamlined process to access web content.

**How it Works:**
- Simply prefix your URL with `web+bb://`.
- For example, to open `https://example.com`, use `web+bb://https://example.com`.
- The link will automatically open in BrowserBox, providing a seamless browsing experience.

This update is part of our ongoing commitment to enhance BrowserBox and make your web experience as efficient and enjoyable as possible. Try out these new features and let us know what you think!

Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, happy browsing with BrowserBox!

## Zero Trust Installation Guide

**üåü Video Installation Guide for Pro: [https://youtu.be/cGUJCCPDWNE](https://youtu.be/cGUJCCPDWNE)**

For detailed information and progress updates, please refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/dosyago/BrowserBox).

## Installation

Follow these instructions to install BrowserBoxPro on your system.

### Initial Machine Setup

Before installing BrowserBox, ensure that your system meets the following minimum requirements:

- VPS with 1 cores, 1 GB RAM, and 25 GB SSD (e.g. Nanode from Linode)
- At least 5 Mbps internet connection
- A public hostname with a DNS A record pointing to your VPS's IP address, or localhost certificates installed on your local and remote machine (for example using [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)).

we assume Debian or Ubuntu in the below but the install process works on CentOS, Fedora, Kali, Ubuntu, RedHat, macOS, Almalinux and Amazon Linux. For supported versions of these operating systems see [this table](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox#supported-server-os-table).

First, update your distribution:

`apt update && apt -y upgrade`

And install a few basic tools:

`apt install curl git wget`

Now, prepare the machine by following these steps:

1. Create a new user to operate BrowserBox:
   ```
   adduser pro
   ```

2. Disable the password for the newly created user:
   ```
   usermod -L pro
   ```

3. Create a new group for sudo privileges:
   ```
   addgroup sudoers
   ```

4. Add the following line to the sudoers file to avoid entering a password for sudo operations:
   ```
   %sudoers ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
   ```
   Use the `visudo` command to edit the sudoers file.

5. Grant sudo privileges to the user:
   ```
   usermod -aG sudoers pro
   ```

Switch to the `pro` user by executing the following command:
```
su - pro
```

### Installation Process

Follow these steps to install BrowserBoxPro:

1. Clone the BrowserBox repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd BrowserBox
   ```

3. Run the global installation script, replacing `<domain_name>` with your domain name that points to the machine you're setting up (if you want to use it without a domain name, just use `localhost` here for the domain name, but you'll still need to copy the correct mkcert localsthost certificates to $HOME/sslcerts later). Use your `<email>` to agree to our terms and the LetsEncrypt terms:
   ```
   ./deploy-scripts/global_install.sh <domain_name> <email>
   ```

4. Start the main service on port 8080 and generate the login link:
   ```
   setup_bbpro --port 8080
   ```

5. Launch BrowserBox:
   ```
   bbpro
   ```

During the installation process, BrowserBox will automatically install the required dependencies and configure the necessary settings.

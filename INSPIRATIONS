# Here are some inspirations for future directions

And a bit more context: BrowserBox was originally designed as a delivery layer for clientless web scraping robot authoring. With BrowserBox you can create web scraping agents on your iPhone, from a normal web browser, from anywhere.

However the cybersecurity use case became apparent, and BrowserBox for RBI was factored out as a product layer, that quickly took over all other development. 

The realization of the original goal of BrowserBox as a delivery layer for authoring web scrapers will occur. 

Now are are in the age of AI, so likely AI will be a useful part of the shape of that product.

Here's some inspirations (not solely limited to this automation use case), regarding BrowserBox and how it can be used right now, or could be used in future!

- there's something powerful about reducing everything to the same style

as if you've power over it. no longer chattering and noisy, no longer in the colors of your trauma or voices from the past, critics or insults, but all in the same style. everything the same. in a way like the experience of life. easier to handle, than every web page imposing its weird and unique aesthetic on your experience and communications

- textacular
- noise cancellation for your mind
- noise cancellation for the web
- something between reader mode and the full modern web
- an experiment in focus, and browsing
- a terminal client... for everything

- somehow bromine rings in my mind. those orange phosphors of my youth, alien terminals, flashing cursors. cathode rays
- maybe a theme? Bromine mode hahaha

- a terminal client for the web
- a browser for constrained environments
  - constrained resources? kernel
  - constrained bandwidth? kernel
  - constrained attention? kernel
  - constrained content? kernel
  - security constraints? kernel

Kernel Browser - a text-only terminal client for the modern web

Medium is the message.

I think the real superpower of this is it can open the internet up to thousands of devices that don't have graphical displays or modern displays. the ultimate text render client in ansi will be simple enough we can stream it over the network to any client. You can write clients in this for any language.

A focus of this kernel project should be the publishing of an API document that allows creation of these thin clients, plus a conversion of the NodeJS client to a thin client in C, or C++ or Rust or something.

Call it "wire" or "ultrathin" or "ultrafine"

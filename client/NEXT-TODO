- select inputs
- radio inputs (and test page)

Next
  - allow copy (for visual breakout)
  - reset terminal on exit (so normal)
  - redraw element with any style identical layout (not duplicate and and break) (ie, IMG and some wide layouts it's a bit off like nypost or SRPs)
  - Fix some elements are not highlighted on focus. Possible causes:
    1. the element has bounds overlapping offscreen.
  - Between page loads need to clear some state (getting node no longer exists, input elements from previous renders likely still being rendered)
  - ensure gaps are "correct" (where they should be, not weird random space after inline, etc)
  - ensure layout remains correct beofre proceeding to following:
  - hook modals for file upload.
  - add ALT text for media placeholders (maybe decide based on space available? Or just make space. Problem is alt text has not text layout boxes so we'd have to create our own, and handle wrapping and truncation etc)
  - scrollin : within local tui "virtual TUI viewport" (larger than TUI page to account for the stuff we push rightward and downward for layout), implement hoz and vert scrolling to show "pushed for layout" content, that blends to scrolling the remote when reaching the margins of that virtual viewport - also ensure we "size the remote" to a "good size" relative to our local TUI dimensions
  - Nice to get to: rendering of autocomplete (and other live dom changes): shows but only if we trigger re-render with scroll, but then we can't click on the autocomplete options, even tho they register as clickable, or the clicks have no effect on remote

Minor Polishing Bugs
  - inputs and omnibox should scroll rightward when we type beyond their right margin (up to any maxlength)
  - some inputs persist over page navigation, new document creation. we need to clear them when DOM is cleared, document navigated. 
  - fix some seeming off by 1 / gap errors. eg lobste.rs login page
  - test13 - Clipped Child Text is not displayed on GUI but is not TUI - minor occlusion edge case bug
  - as usual follow our debug process:
    - find out why this happens with a targeted simple reproduction
    - solve the biggest cause we can
  - ddg srp: larry page - wikipedia info box. "Wikipedia" source link at end of paragraph is occluded down to "ia" - why?
  - If multiple tabs then we are pulling data from all tabs, when we should only focus on active.
  - GitHub code view, like a code file, doesn't work. Looks weird. RAW works beautifully tho. 

Marketing (excerpt, full plan elsewhere)
  - suggest pair with a font, recommend a certain terminal font that works well with displaying web contents

Features
  - file upload
  - file download (to ~/Downloads)
  - enhance cursoring / scrolling - horizontal scroll into window, same for virt, before hit margin and trigger actual page scroll
  - special KEYS when not in focused inputs:
    - ] next tab, [ previous tab
    - / searching for elements on current page (highlight matches, n/N next/prev focus)
    - ? brings up commands help modal
    - d/u down and up (moves down the page a chunk - key based scroll)
    - bv - breakout visual (get login link for opening in browser, useful for solving captcha etc - two code key, gives you a special timed login link that gives you 1 minute of time, and you can only get two such every 5 minutes, and 3 such per 20 minutes, it disconnects you from visual and prevents any other visual connection once consumed)
  - CTRL_M / RIGHT MOUSE - context menu (open in new tab, open in incognito tab, clear history, nuke all history and site data, copy, paste, history - open chrome://history)
  - CTRL_A in inputs select all text with predictable results.
  - SHIFT cursor in inputs selects text. 
  - CTRL_Q also quits. 

For release
  - add licensing checks to krnl as well!
  - capture loading events from browserbox and display a 2x2 or 3x2 cursor "square" at screen right (like Netscape loading logo), showing loading (maybe just cursor rotating inside it clockwise. 1.5 - 2 Hz  
  - improve efficiency of rendering. Only split snapshot on visible boxes.
  - as much as possible limit our data processing to only visible nodes and parts of tree we need to look at relevant to those

BrowserBox side
  - frames are not syncing to normal bb if text is connected.
  - targets are also not syncing.

-- Later -- i.e., to be omitted from initial public release
  - put media placeholders behind a toggle. So normally it's off, but you can toggle it on to view it (toggle setting will rerender)
  - rendering of OOPIF (as that involves fetching target info from separate target and stitching together)
  - web side client for this text layout of the web

-- Cutting Room (ideas that may not increase revenue and may perturb the simplicity of design)
  - CTRL_S - save page html (current as is from snapshot, or root outerHTML like from call func on)
  - LEFT MOUSE - on any normal clickable element (navigates/clicks it) (already have this).
  - SHIFT LEFT MOUSE - on any element shows some details about it (summary, alt for image, title for those that have it, etc)
  - CTRL_H - highlight mode, highlight a different region (different to focus). Commands when highlighted: d (delete), c (cutout - delete rest), s (append text to clips file), y (copy / yank / yoink - to clipboard). hjkl cursor around. io zoom in/out (of layers/z-index/stack), x (explode, show a details panel with node attributes, including alt/title)
  - loading spinner in top / bottom right (floating and "fade out")
  - "status line" in bottom left (show, then disappear after a second)
  - (+dn plugin) r - rip/record - start recording so page and all content you access from now will be accessible in your local archive even when offline (not available on thin client as there's no browser there)
  - CTRL_F - find in page and highlight. CTRL_G find next and scroll to it. SHIFT CTRL_G find previous and scroll to it.

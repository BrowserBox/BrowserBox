- stacking contexts, z-index, anything-besides-transparent background occluding. Invisible layers should not be rendered
( this should hide a lot of weird floating menus that many pages end up with )
- add placeholders for clickable images/media (something like [IMAGE] [IMG] [I], [VIDEO], [AUDIO],  depending on space available, and we can also show alt)
- ensure gaps are "correct" (where they should be, not weird random space after inline, etc)
- improve efficiency of rendering. Only split snapshot on visible boxes.
- form controls
- ensure layout remains correct beofre proceeding
- within local tui "virtual TUI viewport" (larger than TUI page to account for the stuff we push rightward and downward for layout), implement hoz and vert scrolling to show "pushed for layout" content, that blends to scrolling the remote when reaching the margins of that virtual viewport - also ensure we "size the remote" to a "good size" relative to our local TUI dimensions
- hook modals for js modals (alert, confirm, prompt), http basic auth, and file upload.

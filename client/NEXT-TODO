- ensure gaps are "correct" (where they should be, not weird random space after inline, etc)
- vertical deconflict using hoz algoirthm dual
- add placeholders for clickable images/media (something like [IMAGE] [IMG] [I], [VIDEO], [AUDIO],  depending on space available, and we can also show alt)
- form controls
- ensure we are only "splitting snapshot" for visible nodes, not everything (too expensive otherwise on big pages)
- ensure layout remains correct beofre proceeding
- stacking contexts, z-index, anything-besides-transparent background occluding. Invisible layers should not be rendered
- within local tui "virtual TUI viewport" (larger than TUI page to account for the stuff we push rightward and downward for layout), implement hoz and vert scrolling to show "pushed for layout" content, that blends to scrolling the remote when reaching the margins of that virtual viewport
- hook modals for js modals (alert, confirm, prompt), http basic auth, and file upload.

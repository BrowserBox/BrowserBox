# Understanding

This is what I understand when signing the Azure Quickstart CLA to submit my ARM template that deploys BrowserBox to the Azure Quickstart Templates repository.

----

1. **Broad License Grant**: The CLA grants Microsoft extensive rights to use, modify, distribute, and create derivative works from your submission (the ARM template). This means Microsoft can potentially use the template in ways that might extend beyond your initial intent. It's important to consider how this broad licensing might intersect with the functionalities and components included in your ARM template.

2. **Impact on Deployed Software**: Although the CLA doesn't directly transfer IP rights of the software deployed by the ARM template, the way Microsoft can use the template could influence the use of that software. For example, if the ARM template configures or deploys proprietary software, Microsoft's ability to modify and redistribute the template could indirectly affect how this software is set up or utilized.

3. **Originality and Third-party Material**: You are required to ensure that your submission is your original work. If it contains third-party material, you must acknowledge this, maintaining appropriate copyright and license information. This is crucial if your ARM template includes scripts, code snippets, or configurations that are sourced from third-party software or libraries.

4. **Patent Rights**: By granting a patent license, you allow Microsoft to use any of your patent claims that are necessarily infringed by your submission. This could be significant if your ARM template or the deployed software involves patented technology or methods. It’s vital to assess whether any part of your solution is patent-protected and how this agreement might affect those rights.

5. **Employer and Corporate IP**: Since you're submitting on behalf of your company (BrowserBox), it’s essential that all relevant stakeholders in your company are aware of and agree to the terms of this CLA. The agreement should be reviewed by your legal team to ensure it aligns with your company's IP strategy and policies, especially considering that the term "You" in the agreement refers to both you and your employer collectively.

6. **No Warranty and Support Obligations**: The CLA specifies that submissions are provided without warranty of any kind, and you're not required to provide support for your submission, unless you choose to do so. This means that any issues arising from the use or modification of your ARM template by others, including Microsoft, are not your responsibility to resolve, unless you explicitly agree to provide such support.

7. **Public Disclosure**: Contributions to projects and information about contributions, including your name and other submission details, may be maintained indefinitely and disclosed publicly. This could have implications for how your company's contributions are perceived and used in the public domain.

8. **Governing Law and Jurisdiction**: The agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Washington, and any disputes will be handled in the courts of King County, Washington. This choice of jurisdiction and governing law should be considered, especially if it differs from your company's location or usual business jurisdiction.

9. **Assignment and Entire Agreement**: The CLA can be assigned by Microsoft, and it represents the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter. This means that any previous understandings or agreements not included in this CLA are not considered part of the agreement related to your submission.

Contributor License Agreement
Contribution License Agreement
This Contribution License Agreement (“Agreement”) is agreed to by the party signing below (“You”),
and conveys certain license rights to Microsoft Corporation and its affiliates (“Microsoft”) for Your
contributions to Microsoft open source projects. This Agreement is effective as of the latest signature
date below.

Definitions.
“Code” means the computer software code, whether in human-readable or machine-executable form,
that is delivered by You to Microsoft under this Agreement.
“Project” means any of the projects owned or managed by Microsoft and offered under a license
approved by the Open Source Initiative (www.opensource.org).
“Submit” is the act of uploading, submitting, transmitting, or distributing code or other content to any
Project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of
discussing and improving that Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Submission.”
“Submission” means the Code and any other copyrightable material Submitted by You, including any
associated comments and documentation.
Your Submission. You must agree to the terms of this Agreement before making a Submission to any
Project. This Agreement covers any and all Submissions that You, now or in the future (except as
described in Section 4 below), Submit to any Project.
Originality of Work. You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work.
Should You wish to Submit materials that are not Your original work, You may Submit them separately
to the Project if You (a) retain all copyright and license information that was in the materials as You
received them, (b) in the description accompanying Your Submission, include the phrase “Submission
containing materials of a third party:” followed by the names of the third party and any licenses or other
restrictions of which You are aware, and (c) follow any other instructions in the Project’s written
guidelines concerning Submissions.
Your Employer. References to “employer” in this Agreement include Your employer or anyone else
for whom You are acting in making Your Submission, e.g. as a contractor, vendor, or agent. If Your
Submission is made in the course of Your work for an employer or Your employer has intellectual
property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable law, You must secure permission from Your
employer to make the Submission before signing this Agreement. In that case, the term “You” in this
Agreement will refer to You and the employer collectively. If You change employers in the future and
desire to Submit additional Submissions for the new employer, then You agree to sign a new Agreement
and secure permission from the new employer before Submitting those Submissions.
Licenses.
Copyright License. You grant Microsoft, and those who receive the Submission directly or
indirectly from Microsoft, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license in the
Submission to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute
the Submission and such derivative works, and to sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third
parties.
Patent License. You grant Microsoft, and those who receive the Submission directly or
indirectly from Microsoft, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license under
Your patent claims that are necessarily infringed by the Submission or the combination of the
Submission with the Project to which it was Submitted to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell and
import or otherwise dispose of the Submission alone or with the Project.
Other Rights Reserved. Each party reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement.
No additional licenses or rights whatsoever (including, without limitation, any implied licenses) are
granted by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.
Representations and Warranties. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above
licenses. You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work (except as You may
have disclosed under Section 3). You represent that You have secured permission from Your employer to
make the Submission in cases where Your Submission is made in the course of Your work for Your
employer or Your employer has intellectual property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable
law. If You are signing this Agreement on behalf of Your employer, You represent and warrant that You
have the necessary authority to bind the listed employer to the obligations contained in this Agreement.
You are not expected to provide support for Your Submission, unless You choose to do so. UNLESS
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, AND EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES
EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTIONS 3, 4, AND 6, THE SUBMISSION PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS
PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY OF
NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
Notice to Microsoft. You agree to notify Microsoft in writing of any facts or circumstances of which
You later become aware that would make Your representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any
respect.
Information about Submissions. You agree that contributions to Projects and information about
contributions may be maintained indefinitely and disclosed publicly, including Your name and other
information that You submit with Your Submission.
Governing Law/Jurisdiction. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Washington, and
the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts sitting in King County,
Washington, unless no federal subject matter jurisdiction exists, in which case the parties consent to
exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington. The parties waive all
defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens.
Entire Agreement/Assignment. This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties, and
supersedes any and all prior agreements, understandings or communications, written or oral, between
the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be assigned by Microsoft.

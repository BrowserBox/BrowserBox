### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start it
When your repo checklist is complete and options above are set, **comment** `start` or `run`

The action will post the login details in a comment when your server is active (takes 5 - 10 minutes to install). Sessions run for ~40 minutes by default.

**Privacy notes**
- Issue comments are visible to anyone with repo access.
- If **Encrypt** is checked and you have an **SSH RSA** key on GitHub, your link will be posted **encrypted** with that key; only your matching private key can decrypt it. We‚Äôll include a one-liner to decrypt locally.

                  most similar experience to browsing on your normal insecure browser, without

                  enables the secure and reliable provision of fully managed,

                <p>
                  BrowserBox never runs any remote code on your machine. Ever. We never run any JavaScript, applets, CSS and not even one tag of HTML on your machine that comes from the remote browser. Our platform is the only browser isolation system that can run on any device, and never runs any code on your machine. We provide a fully interactive image of the remote web page, that looks and feels just like browsing on your favorite consumer browser, but without any of the regular risks associated with that.

                <p>
                  Browser isolation is a security practise where you isolate 
                  your network from the internet. All browsing is conducted over a secure channel, using an isolated, and remote, cloud browser.

                <h1>How does browser isolation help secure my network?</h1>
                <p>
                  Our full isolation system means never is any JavaScript code, images, HTML, CSS or other assets from a remote page sent to you. You interact with the internet via a secure layer, similar to a scientist doing experiments in a fume hood or hazmat isolation in a biological safety cabinet. The principle is very similar with our total isolation system ensuring a constant "negative pressure" from the web to you. Meaning that no web content actually reaches you, except via a holographic image of that content that is fully interactive yet totally inert.

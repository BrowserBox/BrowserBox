```sh
# Clone the treasure!
git clone https://github.com/dosyago/chai.git
# Enter the magical kingdom
cd chai
# Set up the wizardry
./scripts/setup.sh
# Ignite the spark!
./scripts/restart.sh

## 🌠 Pro Tips and Tricks 🌠

- Got SSL certs? Place them in `$HOME/sslcerts/` and we'll go HTTPS! 🌐
- Tweak the `secret=<your secret>` URL parameter for extra magical powers. 🌟
- Document lifespan is 3 days by default, but feel free to change that in `/public/uploads/clean.sh`. 🕰️

## 🎉 Turn It into an API 🎉

Want more? Use the POST endpoint with a `secret=` parameter to authorize conversion via a secure HTTPS API.

---

## 🌈 System Requirements 🌈

We recommend a beefy machine with at least 4 cores and 8 GB RAM for a spellbinding experience.

# Enhanced Security Protocols Implementation

This document describes the enhanced security protocols implemented in BrowserBox, including challenge-response authentication and mutual authentication.

## Overview

The enhanced security protocols add two critical security features:

1. **Challenge-Response Authentication**: Prevents replay attacks by requiring the client to sign a unique nonce provided by the server
2. **Mutual Authentication**: Prevents MITM attacks by verifying the server's identity through signature verification

## Implementation Details

### 1. Client-Side JavaScript (`src/hard/hardenedApplication.js`)

#### Changes to `validateLicense` Method

The `validateLicense` method now accepts an optional `useChallenge` parameter (default: `true`):

```javascript
async validateLicense(attempt = 0, useChallenge = true)
```

**Challenge-Response Flow:**

1. **Request Challenge Nonce**: Before validation, the client sends a POST request to `/tickets/challenge` with the `seatId`
2. **Sign Nonce**: The client signs the received nonce using the seat's private key from the certificate chain
3. **Include in Validation**: The `challengeNonce` and `nonceSignature` are included in the validation request payload

**Mutual Authentication:**

1. **Receive Server Signature**: After successful validation, the server response includes a `serverSignature` field
2. **Verify Signature**: The client verifies this signature using the stadium's public key from the certificate chain
3. **Prevent MITM**: If verification fails, the authentication is rejected as a potential MITM attack

**Fallback Behavior:**

- If challenge-response setup fails, the system gracefully falls back to non-challenge mode
- All existing retry logic and error handling is preserved
- The reservation code flow remains unchanged

#### Changes to `checkLicense` Method

The same challenge-response and mutual authentication logic has been applied to `checkLicense` to ensure consistency across all license validation paths.

### 2. Server-Side Shell Script (`deploy-scripts/_bbcertify.sh`)

#### New Helper Functions

Two helper functions were added to encapsulate Node.js crypto operations:

```bash
sign_with_node()    # Signs data with a private key
verify_with_node()  # Verifies signature with a public key
```

These functions use inline Node.js scripts to perform cryptographic operations, maintaining the script's existing dependencies.

#### Changes to `validate_ticket_with_server` Function

**Challenge-Response Flow:**

1. **Extract seatId**: Extracts the `seatId` from the ticket JSON
2. **Request Nonce**: Makes a POST request to `/tickets/challenge` endpoint
3. **Sign Nonce**: Uses `sign_with_node()` to sign the nonce with the seat's private key
4. **Send Validation**: Includes `challengeNonce` and `nonceSignature` in the validation request

**Mutual Authentication:**

1. **Extract Server Signature**: Retrieves `serverSignature` from the validation response
2. **Verify Signature**: Uses `verify_with_node()` to verify the server's signature
3. **Log Result**: Logs success or warning (currently non-blocking for compatibility)

**Fallback Behavior:**

- If challenge nonce request fails, the script falls back to non-challenge validation
- All error messages maintain consistency with the original implementation
- The script's command-line interface remains unchanged

### 3. API Consistency

Both implementations maintain **100% backward compatibility**:

- Command-line arguments remain unchanged
- Function signatures accept new parameters but with sensible defaults
- Fallback mechanisms ensure functionality even if server doesn't support new endpoints
- Error handling preserves existing behavior

## Security Benefits

### Protection Against Replay Attacks

The challenge-response mechanism ensures that even if an attacker intercepts a valid authentication request, they cannot replay it because:

1. Each nonce is unique and time-limited
2. The signature is bound to that specific nonce
3. Replayed requests will fail nonce validation

### Protection Against MITM Attacks

The mutual authentication mechanism ensures the client can verify the server's identity:

1. Server proves identity by signing the `instanceId` with its private key
2. Client verifies using the stadium's public key from the trusted certificate chain
3. Attackers cannot forge signatures without the stadium's private key

### Defense in Depth

- **Multiple layers**: Both client and server verify each other
- **Cryptographic proof**: Uses standard RSA signatures (SHA256)
- **Graceful degradation**: Falls back safely if new features unavailable
- **No single point of failure**: Multiple checks at different stages

## Testing

Unit tests in `tests/test-enhanced-security.js` verify:

1. ✓ Challenge-response implementation in hardenedApplication.js
2. ✓ Signing and verification functionality
3. ✓ Data structure correctness
4. ✓ Payload structure for challenge-response
5. ✓ Mutual authentication response structure
6. ✓ Challenge-response implementation in _bbcertify.sh

All tests pass successfully.

## Integration Requirements

### Server-Side Requirements

For the enhanced security to function, the license server must implement:

1. **Challenge Endpoint**: `POST /tickets/challenge`
   - Input: `{ "seatId": "<seat-id>" }`
   - Output: `{ "nonce": "<unique-nonce>" }`

2. **Enhanced Validation Endpoint**: `POST /tickets/validate`
   - Additional input fields: `challengeNonce`, `nonceSignature`
   - Additional output field: `serverSignature`

3. **Nonce Management**:
   - Generate cryptographically secure nonces
   - Implement time-based expiration (e.g., 60 seconds)
   - Store nonces temporarily to prevent reuse

4. **Server Signature**:
   - Sign the client's `instanceId` with stadium's private key
   - Include signature in successful validation responses

### Client-Side Configuration

No additional configuration required. The enhanced security is enabled by default with automatic fallback.

## Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements:

1. **Configurable timeout**: Allow nonce expiration time to be configured
2. **Stricter fallback**: Option to require challenge-response (fail if unavailable)
3. **Nonce rotation**: More frequent nonce changes for additional security
4. **Certificate pinning**: Additional protection against certificate substitution
5. **Rate limiting**: Client-side rate limiting for challenge requests

## Conclusion

The enhanced security protocols significantly improve BrowserBox's authentication security without breaking existing functionality. The implementation follows best practices for cryptographic authentication and includes comprehensive fallback mechanisms for smooth deployment.

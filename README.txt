  [1] WHASSUP WITH BROWSERBOX?
  -----------------------------
  BROWSERBOX IS THE REAL DEAL - A REMOTE BROWSER THAT RUNS IN A FUCKING
  FORTRESS, KEEPING YOUR NETWORK SAFE FROM MALWARE, RANSOMWARE, AND ALL
  THAT ZERO-DAY BULLSHIT. IT’S LIKE HAVING A 486 DX2 IN THE CLOUD,
  BLASTING THROUGH WEB CRAP WITHOUT TOUCHING YOUR PRECIOUS LOCAL BOX.
  SYSADMINS, HACKERS, PHREAKS - THIS IS YOUR TICKET TO SURFING THE NET
  WITHOUT GETTING PWND!

  FEATURES THAT SLAP:
  - ISOLATION SO TIGHT EVEN KEVIN MITNICK COULDN’T CRACK IT
  - ZERO LATENCY MODE (NEW IN v10 - FUCK YEAH!)
  - MOBILE-READY, CHROME-POWERED GOODNESS
  - CUSTOMIZE THAT SHIT TO YOUR HEART’S CONTENT

  [2] WHY YOU NEED A LICENSE
  ---------------------------
  THIS AIN’T SHAREWARE, DUDE! BROWSERBOX v10 NEEDS A LICENSE KEY TO RUN.
  NO KEY? YOU GET A 2-MINUTE WARNING AND THEN BAM - SHUTDOWN CITY.
  HIT UP sales@dosaygo.com FOR A COMMERCIAL KEY OR JUMP ON THE NON-
  COMMERCIAL WAITLIST AT tally.so/r/nPvb1x. WHY? ‘CAUSE WE’RE KEEPING
  THIS SHIT LEGIT AND SUPPORTED, NOT SOME WAREZ CRAP THAT DIES IN A WEEK.

  LICENSED PERKS:
  - FULL ACCESS TO THE GOODS (NO CRIPPLED DEMO MODE)
  - KEEP THE MAN OFF YOUR BACK (WE TRACK USAGE - CHECK PRIVACY.TXT)
  - BYPASS THIS AND WE’LL SUE YOUR ASS (TERMS.TXT, BITCHES)

  [3] BBX - YOUR COMMAND LINE SIDEKICK FROM HELL
  -----------------------------------------------
  MEET `BBX` - THE CLI THAT MAKES BROWSERBOX SING! IT’S LIKE HAVING A
  HACKER’S SWISS ARMY KNIFE IN YOUR TERMINAL. NO GUI BULLSHIT HERE -
  JUST RAW POWER. HERE’S THE FULL RUNDOWN:

    /etc/sudoers OR GTFO).

    LEGIT. NON-COMMERCIAL? WAITLIST IT UP!

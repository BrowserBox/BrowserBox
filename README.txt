  [1] WHASSUP WITH BROWSERBOX?
  -----------------------------
  BROWSERBOX IS THE REAL SHIT - A REMOTE BROWSER RUNNING IN A DAMN
  BUNKER, KEEPING YOUR NETWORK SAFE FROM MALWARE, RANSOMWARE, AND ALL
  THOSE ASSHOLE ZERO-DAY TRICKS. IT'S LIKE A 486 DX2 IN THE CLOUD,
  RIPPING THROUGH WEB CRAP WITHOUT FUCKING UP YOUR LOCAL RIG. SYSADMINS,
  HACKERS, PHREAKS - THIS IS YOUR GOLDEN TICKET TO SURF THE NET WITHOUT
  GETTING OWNED!

  FEATURES THAT KICK ASS:
  - ISOLATION TIGHTER THAN A DRUM, EVEN MITNICK COULDN'T BUST IT
  - ZERO LATENCY MODE (NEW IN v10 - FUCK YEAH!)
  - MOBILE-READY, CHROME-POWERED AWESOMENESS
  - TWEAK THAT SHIT TO YOUR HEART'S DELIGHT

  [2] WHY YOU NEED A LICENSE
  ---------------------------
  THIS AIN'T NO FREEWARE, BRO! BROWSERBOX v10 DEMANDS A LICENSE KEY TO
  ROLL. NO KEY? YOU GET A 2-MINUTE HEADS-UP THEN BAM - SHIT'S OVER.
  SCORE ONE AT sales@dosaygo.com FOR COMMERCIAL USE OR HIT THE NON-
  COMMERCIAL WAITLIST AT tally.so/r/nPvb1x. WHY? 'CAUSE WE'RE KEEPING
  THIS FUCKING THING LEGIT AND ALIVE, NOT SOME LAME WAREZ THAT CRASHES
  OUT LIKE A BITCH.

  LICENSED GOODIES:
  - FULL ACCESS TO THE JUICY STUFF (NO CRIPPLED MODE)
  - KEEP THE SUITS OFF YOUR ASS (WE TRACK USAGE - SEE PRIVACY.TXT)
  - FUCK WITH LICENSING AND WE'LL KICK YOUR DAMN BUTT (TERMS.TXT, DUDE)

  [3] BBX - YOUR CLI SIDEKICK FROM THE DEPTHS
  --------------------------------------------
  MEET `BBX` - THE COMMAND LINE TOOL THAT MAKES BROWSERBOX SCREAM! IT'S
  LIKE A PHREAKER'S LEATHERMAN IN YOUR TERM - NO GUI NONSENSE, JUST PURE
  FUCKING POWER. HERE'S THE DIRTY LOWDOWN:

  **INSTALL THAT SHIT**
  - VIA BASH PIPE:
    $ bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/refs/heads/docker-imps/bbx.sh) install
  - VIA NPM (GLOBAL STYLE):
    $ npm i -g @browserbox/browserbox
  - BOTH DROP BROWSERBOX AND BBX LIKE A TON OF FUCKING BRICKS. NEED
    PASSWORDLESS SUDO (EDIT /etc/sudoers OR BAIL).

  **ACTIVATE YOUR LICENSE**
  $ bbx activate [seats]
  - GRAB A KEY FOR YOUR POSSE (1 SEAT DEFAULT). PAY VIA STRIPE, GET
    LEGIT. NON-COMMERCIAL? WAITLIST THAT SHIT!

  **COMMAND LINE MADNESS**
  - bbx install        - SLAM IT DOWN, SET IT UP
  - bbx uninstall      - NUKE EVERYTHING, GONE LIKE A BAD DREAM
  - bbx activate [seats] - BUY YOUR WAY IN (SEATS = USERS)
  - bbx setup [-p <port>] [-h <host>] [-t <token>] - TUNE THAT BEAST
  - bbx certify        - LOCK IN YOUR KEY, MAKE IT REAL
  - bbx run [-p <port>] [-h <host>] - LAUNCH BROWSERBOX, SURF HARD
  - bbx stop           - KILL IT DEAD (CURRENT USER ONLY)
  - bbx run-as [--temporary] <user> [<port>] - RUN AS ANOTHER DUDE, TEMP
    WIPES 'EM OUT
  - bbx stop-user <user> [<delay>] - SMASH A USER'S RUN, DELAY IN SECS
  - bbx logs           - PEEK AT THE LOGS, KNOW THE SCORE
  - bbx update         - SNAG THE LATEST, KEEP IT FRESH
  - bbx status         - IS IT ALIVE OR TOAST?
  - bbx tor-run [--no-anonymize] [--no-onion] - GO DARK WITH TOR, SCREW
    THE SYSTEM
  - bbx docker-run [<nick>] [-p <port>] - SPIN UP A DOCKER MONSTER, NAME IT
  - bbx docker-stop <nick> - SHUT THAT DOCKER CRAP DOWN
  - bbx --version      - FLEX YOUR BUILD NUMBER
  - bbx --help         - READ THE FUCKING MANUAL, NEWBIE

  EXAMPLE RAMPAGE:
  $ bbx docker-run hackmaster -p 666
  - FIRES UP A DOCKERIZED BROWSERBOX ON PORT 666, CALLS IT "HACKMASTER"
  $ bbx docker-stop hackmaster
  - BLASTS THAT SHIT TO HELL

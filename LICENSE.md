            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of BrowserBox, except as permitted by applicable law;</li>
            <li>Use BrowserBox, its source code, documentation, or any data derived therefrom (including but not limited to screenshots, telemetry, interaction patterns, or DOM structures) to train, fine-tune, or develop any artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural network, large language model (LLM), or other automated system;</li>

        <p><strong>4.2 Open-Source Components.</strong> BrowserBox may include open-source components subject to their own licenses. In case of conflict, those licenses govern the use of those components only.</p>
        <p><strong>4.3 Usage Monitoring.</strong> BrowserBox may transmit usage data to DOSAYGO for compliance verification and product improvement, as detailed in DOSAYGO’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</p>

        <p><strong>5.1 Intellectual Property.</strong> DOSAYGO and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in BrowserBox, including all intellectual property rights. This Agreement does not transfer ownership to Licensee.</p>
        <p><strong>5.2 Source Code Access.</strong> If Licensee accesses BrowserBox source code, modifications are permitted for internal use only, but ownership remains with DOSAYGO.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3 Enforcement.</strong> Any attempt to tamper with the License Key system will result in immediate termination of this license.</p>
    </section>

        <p><strong>6.2 Effect of Termination.</strong> Upon termination, Licensee must:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Delete all copies of BrowserBox and License Keys in its possession;</li>
            <li>Acknowledge that DOSAYGO may remotely disable access.</li>

    </section>
    <section id="section7">
        <h2>7. Consequences of Unauthorized Use</h2>
        <p>In the event of Unauthorized Use, Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days of notice from DOSAYGO or discovery of such use: (i) pay to DOSAYGO a retroactive license fee equal to two hundred percent (200%) of the then-current standard license fee for the applicable usage tier, prorated from the date of initial Unauthorized Use, plus interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month; and (ii) execute a valid license agreement under DOSAYGO’s standard terms. In addition, Licensee hereby grants to DOSAYGO an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, perform, display, and create derivative works of the Integrated Works, as well as any artificial intelligence models, weights, or datasets developed in violation of Section 2.3, effective immediately upon Unauthorized Use. Licensee is expressly prohibited from publicly releasing, open-sourcing, or otherwise making available the source code of the Integrated Works or the aforementioned AI assets under any open-source license or public repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or any platform accessible without restriction) without DOSAYGO’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The retroactive license fee represents a reasonable estimate of DOSAYGO’s lost licensing revenue, which is difficult to ascertain precisely due to the nature of unauthorized integration. Failure to comply with any obligation herein shall entitle DOSAYGO to seek specific performance, damages, and all other available remedies, including attorneys’ fees.</p>

DOSAYGO shall not be liable for indirect, consequential, incidental, or punitive damages, including lost profits or data.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="section9">

<h1>BROWSERBOX LICENSE AGREEMENT</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date: March 1, 2025</strong><br>
<strong>Version: 10.0.0</strong></p>

<p><strong>READ THIS CAREFULLY. BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR USING BROWSERBOX, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. NO PAYMENT, NO USE—SIMPLE AS THAT. IF YOU DON’T AGREE, DON’T TOUCH THE SOFTWARE. IF YOU’RE ACTING FOR A COMPANY, YOU CONFIRM YOU CAN BIND IT LEGALLY.</strong></p>

<h2>1. THE BASICS</h2>

<p><strong>1.1 “DOSAYGO”</strong> is DOSAYGO Corporation, based in Oregon, USA. We own BrowserBox.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 “BrowserBox”</strong> is our embeddable, multi-user, server-based browser for remote isolation, zero-trust security, co-browsing, and more. It’s the software you’re licensing here, including updates and docs.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 “You”</strong> means you or the entity you represent.</p>
<p><strong>1.4 “License Key”</strong> is the code you buy from us to unlock BrowserBox. No key, no access.</p>
<p><strong>1.5 “Subscription”</strong> is your paid plan to use BrowserBox. It’s how you get a License Key.</p>

<h2>2. THE DEAL</h2>

<p><strong>2.1 You Get a License.</strong> Pay up, and DOSAYGO grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use BrowserBox based on your Subscription and License Key. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 No License Key, No Dice.</strong> BrowserBox won’t run without a valid License Key. If it’s missing, expired, or fake, you’ll see a message—“Your copy of BrowserBox is unlicensed”—for 2 minutes before it shuts down.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 What You Can’t Do.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Don’t share, sell, rent, or sublicense BrowserBox.</li>
    <li>Don’t mess with the code (reverse engineer, decompile, etc.) unless law or open-source terms say otherwise.</li>
    <li>Don’t strip out our branding or notices.</li>
    <li>Don’t bypass the License Key system—try it, and we’ll kill your access.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. PAYING UP</h2>

<p><strong>3.1 Buy a Subscription.</strong> Head to <a href="https://dosaygo.com/pricing">https://dosaygo.com/pricing</a> (or an authorized seller) to get started. Pricing, billing, and renewals are spelled out there.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Keep It Current.</strong> Subscriptions auto-renew unless you cancel. Miss a payment, and after a short grace period, your License Key dies, and so does BrowserBox.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Commercial Means Everything.</strong> Any use—business, personal-but-for-profit, development, testing, whatever—requires a paid Subscription. No free rides.</p>

<h2>4. USING IT</h2>

<p><strong>4.1 Your Responsibility.</strong> Use BrowserBox for your stuff or your customers’—fine. But you’re on the hook for every instance you run. Customers want to tweak it? They need their own license.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Open-Source Bits.</strong> Some parts might be open-source. If their licenses clash with this one, they win—but only for those bits.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 We’re Watching.</strong> BrowserBox sends analytics to us to check compliance and improve the product. Our Privacy Policy and Terms cover this—read them.</p>

<h2>5. WHO OWNS WHAT</h2>

<p><strong>5.1 We Own It.</strong> DOSAYGO and our partners keep all rights to BrowserBox. You’re just renting it.</p>
<p><strong>5.2 Source Code.</strong> See the code? Modify it for your use if you want, but it’s still ours. No new rights for you.</p>
<p><strong>5.3 Don’t Hack It.</strong> Tamper with the License Key system, and your license is toast—immediately.</p>

<h2>6. ENDING THIS</h2>

<p><strong>6.1 We Can Cut You Off.</strong> Break these rules (a material breach), and we terminate you with notice. Unlicensed use? Instant shutdown, no warning.</p>
<p><strong>6.2 What Happens Next.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Stop using BrowserBox.</li>
    <li>Delete it and all License Keys.</li>
    <li>We’ll disable everything remotely if we have to.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6.3 Some Stuff Sticks.</strong> Liability limits, indemnification, etc.—those live on.</p>

<h2>7. NO PROMISES</h2>

<p><strong>7.1 As Is.</strong> BrowserBox is “AS IS.” No warranties—implied, express, or otherwise. It might break; deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>7.2 Damage Cap.</strong> If something goes wrong, our liability maxes out at $50 USD. No indirect damages, lost profits, or headaches covered.</p>

<h2>8. LEGAL STUFF</h2>

<p><strong>8.1 Oregon Rules.</strong> Oregon law governs this, no exceptions.</p>
<p><strong>8.2 Fight in Oregon.</strong> Disputes go to Oregon courts—state or federal. You agree to show up there.</p>

<h2>9. DATA & PRIVACY</h2>

<p><strong>9.1 Our Side.</strong> We handle data per our Privacy Policy and the law.</p>
<p><strong>9.2 Your Side.</strong> You manage your data legally. Not our problem if you don’t.</p>

<h2>10. SUPPORT? MAYBE</h2>

<p><strong>10.1 No Guarantees.</strong> Updates or help aren’t promised unless you’ve got a separate deal.</p>
<p><strong>10.2 Community Vibes.</strong> Forums or email might help, but don’t hold your breath.</p>

<h2>11. COVERING US</h2>

<p>You’ll defend and pay for any mess caused by your misuse, breaches, or legal screw-ups. Lawyers’ fees included.</p>

<h2>12. FINE PRINT</h2>

<p><strong>12.1 This Is It.</strong> No side deals—this is the whole agreement.</p>
<p><strong>12.2 We Can Update.</strong> Terms might change. Keep using BrowserBox, and you accept the new ones.</p>
<p><strong>12.3 No Handing Off.</strong> You can’t pass this license to anyone without our OK. We can.</p>
<p><strong>12.4 Bits Can Break.</strong> If a rule’s invalid, we’ll tweak it. The rest stands.</p>

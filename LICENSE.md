        <h2>2. License Grant</h2>
        <p><strong>2.1 Grant of License.</strong> Subject to payment of applicable Subscription fees and compliance with this Agreement, DOSAYGO grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use BrowserBox solely for Licensee’s internal business purposes, in accordance with the terms of the Subscription and the associated License Key.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2 License Key Requirement.</strong> Use of BrowserBox requires a valid License Key. Without a valid License Key, BrowserBox will display a warning ("Your copy of BrowserBox is unlicensed") and terminate after two (2) minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>2.3 Restrictions.</strong> Licensee shall not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Share, sell, lease, sublicense, or otherwise distribute BrowserBox to third parties;</li>

        <p><strong>3.2 Subscription Term.</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew unless terminated by Licensee in accordance with the Subscription terms. Failure to pay fees will, after a reasonable grace period, result in deactivation of the License Key and termination of access to BrowserBox.</p>

    <section id="section4">
        <h2>4. Use of BrowserBox</h2>
        <p><strong>4.1 Responsibility.</strong> Licensee is responsible for all instances of BrowserBox it deploys. Use by Licensee’s customers requires separate licenses for those customers.</p>
        <p><strong>4.2 Open-Source Components.</strong> BrowserBox may include open-source components subject to their own licenses. In case of conflict, those licenses govern the use of those components only.</p>
        <p><strong>4.3 Usage Monitoring.</strong> BrowserBox may transmit usage data to DOSAYGO for compliance verification and product improvement, as detailed in DOSAYGO’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</p>

        <p><strong>5.2 Source Code Access.</strong> If Licensee accesses BrowserBox source code, modifications are permitted for internal use only, but ownership remains with DOSAYGO.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3 Enforcement.</strong> Any attempt to tamper with the License Key system will result in immediate termination of this license.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="section6">
        <h2>6. Termination</h2>

        <p><strong>6.2 Effect of Termination.</strong> Upon termination, Licensee must:</p>

    </section>
    <section id="section7">
        <h2>7. Consequences of Unauthorized Use</h2>
        <p>In the event of Unauthorized Use, Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days of notice from DOSAYGO or discovery of such use: (i) pay to DOSAYGO a retroactive license fee equal to two hundred percent (200%) of the then-current standard license fee for the applicable usage tier, prorated from the date of initial Unauthorized Use, plus interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month; and (ii) execute a valid license agreement under DOSAYGO’s standard terms. In addition, Licensee hereby grants to DOSAYGO an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, perform, display, and create derivative works of the Integrated Works, effective immediately upon Unauthorized Use. Licensee is expressly prohibited from publicly releasing, open-sourcing, or otherwise making available the source code of the Integrated Works under any open-source license or public repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or any platform accessible without restriction) without DOSAYGO’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The retroactive license fee represents a reasonable estimate of DOSAYGO’s lost licensing revenue, which is difficult to ascertain precisely due to the nature of unauthorized integration. Failure to comply with any obligation herein shall entitle DOSAYGO to seek specific performance, damages, and all other available remedies, including attorneys’ fees.</p>

        <p><strong>8.2 Limitation of Liability.</strong> DOSAYGO’s aggregate liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the fees paid by Licensee in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim. DOSAYGO shall not be liable for indirect, consequential, incidental, or punitive damages, including lost profits or data.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="section9">

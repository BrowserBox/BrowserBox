You must distribute this file and its exact and entire contents when you distribute any copies or works of BrowserBox.

BrowserBox is licensed separately under the following licenses:

- [Polyform Non-Commercial License 1.0](LICENSES/PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0.md)
- BrowserBox Commercial License, as either perpetual or subscription. Named users or concurrent users are available. Named user licenses are purchasable via [our website](https://dosyago.com).

### Purchasing a commercial license

Once purchased, you’ll receive a commercial license PDF including your agreement and valid Order receipt and you will be all set to use BrowserBox in your commercial applications. With the purchase of a commercial license:

- You may use BrowserBox in as many commercial applications you like.
- You may use BrowserBox in your own commercial applications and products. For example: premium VPN services, RBI systems, system integration portals, web automation and scraping products, educational platforms, and other products and apps.
- Customers and users of your products do not need to purchase their own license — so long as they are not developing their own commercial products with BrowserBox.

*Please note that we cannot transact with sanctioned countries, entities or individuals.* 

Commercial Licenses are priced per seat. A seat is someone who uses the BrowserBox system, either in an internal application (like secure email attachment viewing), or an external customer-facing application (such as a customer of your remote browser isolation product). Commercial Licenses come in two flavors:

- **Perpetual License** This is a license to use the version of BrowserBox you purchase forever. The version can be updated to the latest via purchase of yearly licenses.
- **Yearly License** This is a license to use the latest version available within the 12-months from your purchase. It can be manually renewed every year, or you can subscribe so it renews automatically.

Commercial Licenses are available in two sizes:

- **License Pack** Available in multiple sizes, from the small to the truly epic, with commensurately epic discounts at scale. These are purchasable at [our main website](https://dosyago.com).

By obtaining a commercial license, you gain the freedom to tailor BrowserBox to your specific requirements and integrate it seamlessly into your workflow. This empowers organizations to leverage the advanced features and capabilities of BrowserBox while maintaining full control over its customization and usage. 

Support tiers and customization may be separately negotiated and purchased. To discuss your needs, please [reach out to our helpful support team here](mailto:support@dosyago.com?subject=BrowserBox).

### Hardware Appliance (OEM) Licensing

Are you an OEM and want to deploy BrowserBox on a hardware device that you sell to your customers? [Contact us for special access to Appliance License pricing with Volume Discounts](mailto:sales@dosyago.com?subject=OEM%20License). This pricing sheet and terms are tailored to suit OEM's delivering security products for business and industry. Please note that if you are supplying government or other non-commercial users you cannot "pass through" DOSYAGO's non-commercial license to your customers without licensing a Commercial license from us. 

### Sanctions Compliance

Unfotunately if you or your company are an OFAC sanctioned entity or other entity sanctioned by the US Government (e.g. designated on OFAC's SDN List, BIS's DPL or Entity List, DDTC's DPL, or on the FBI's various lists, among others) we are unable to offer you a license of any form. Please note that in some cases we may conduct necessary checks to ensure sanctions compliance.

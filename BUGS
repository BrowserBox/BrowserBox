- no install dir found /pwd in home/ issue

- disk partition extension func at start of install failing on RHEL

- some deps are not found on rhel (not majro problem)

- install find issue:
  - sometimes (trad setup / trad install) w global_install from a $HOME/BrowserBox directory
  it seems that bbpro or an install process part says: " < some dir > is inside < $HOME > " or maybe " $PWD is inside < HOME > " 
  and then "No valid install directory found". 
  This does not occur with the new bbx install however it is likely related to the changes to how we search for directories
  Likely a little fix in 1 or 2 places will solve this. 

- linger issue:
  - rhel issues with installing audo conf files and no linger : perm denied
  - this is also an issue on Deb/Ub: ./scripts/setup_machine.sh: line 119: /usr/local/lib/systemd/logind.conf.d/nokill.conf: Permission denied

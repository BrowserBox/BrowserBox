- lock out the bg utility pages we open for creating workers from normal set up flow otherwise it might interfere with our stuff.
- ensure we can not display offscreen pages from extensions.
- ensure everything else works properly including:
   - extensions work as we expect
   - tabs are sized to correct viewport on app load (regression?)

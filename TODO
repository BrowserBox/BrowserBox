- ensure we can not display offscreen pages from extensions. (one way to tell is we never get a screencastFrame from the session even tho visibility of screencast is visibile according to the change event). This may be more reliable than the extension way I am exploring.
- ensure everything else works properly including:
   - extensions work as we expect
   - tabs are sized to correct viewport on app load (regression?)

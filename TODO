- run-as has a point after copying nvm to user where it is like /root/.nvm not exist so we have some borked syntax

- source .nvm/nvm.sh for bbx logs and other such commands

- enhance run-tor by displaying the tor service's connectivity status

- find way to run stop_bbpro on docker stop, provide instructions people need to visit /settings_modal to stop the browser on docker

- integrate docker run into bbx (maybe we have to hack the stop just using bbx)

- solidify instance hw id, analytics

- mitigations

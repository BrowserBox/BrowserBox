## BrowserBox Vultr Edition - Powered by xAI

Welcome to **BrowserBox**, your cutting-edge remote browser isolation solution! Your instance is spinning up now—here’s how to get it live and secure in just a few steps.

### 1. Point Your DNS
To connect to your BrowserBox, add a **DNS A record** with your domain provider:  
- **Domain**: `{{hostname}}`  
- **IP**: `{{ip}}`  
This links your shiny new instance to the world!

### 2. Unlock the Firewall
Open these ports in your Vultr firewall settings to let BrowserBox breathe:  
- **80 (HTTP)**: For initial setup and TLS magic.  
- **8080**: Your BrowserBox gateway.  
No fuss, just access—ensure your instance’s firewall rules are updated!

### 3. Log In and Launch
Setup takes up to 60 minutes (time for a coffee or a quick cosmic ponder). Once ready, jump in:  
[**https://{{hostname}}:8080/login?token={{token}}**](https://{{hostname}}:8080/login?token={{token}})  
Boom—you’re browsing the web from a zero-trust fortress!
